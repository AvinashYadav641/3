While we are always eager to work hands-on, one of the most crucial steps before fabricating a project is to implement and simulate it on software to test and optimize the various circuitry and code involved. Build-A-Bot aims to bring to you such an experience, where you will work with a team of 3 to 5 members and realize your projects both on simulation software and hands-on. Here's the¬†rulebook (shorturl.at/cegDR)¬†for more details¬†on the event. Important links¬†and registration form can be found in the rulebook too.\n",

      "We are also happy to announce that we will be hosting a workshop by experts from MathWorks to elaborate¬†more on designing a project to its deployment using MATLAB and Simulink. To collect more information on how the workshop would benefit all of you, we have created this¬†form: https://forms.gle/tGzLxkBpxSEConKs5. Please fill it out so that the workshop can be optimized for your benefit.\n",
